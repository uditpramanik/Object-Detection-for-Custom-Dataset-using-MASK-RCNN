GitHub repository dedicated to advancing the field of object detection through the implementation of Mask R-CNN (Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) on a custom dataset. This project is aimed at researchers, developers, and enthusiasts in the domain of computer vision and machine learning, offering a comprehensive framework to train, evaluate, and deploy Mask R-CNN for object detection tasks on uniquely tailored datasets.

Project Overview
Object detection is a critical task in computer vision, involving the identification and localization of objects within an image. Our focus lies in leveraging Mask R-CNN, a state-of-the-art framework for instance segmentation, to not only detect objects but also precisely segment each instance. This project provides a robust pipeline for applying Mask R-CNN on any dataset, customized to your specific requirements.
